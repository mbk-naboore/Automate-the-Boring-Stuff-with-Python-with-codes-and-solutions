# Automate-the-Boring-Stuff-with-Python-with-codes-and-solutions
These are my solutions to the [Automate the Boring Stuff with Python, 2nd Ed.](https://automatetheboringstuff.com/#toc) practice projects by Al Sweigart. This is a very good book to start your programming learning journey with python. It is free to read, thanks to the author for this wonderful learning metirials he is providing. As the book did not provide the solutions for the Practice Projects, I add my solutions for other learners. Hope this could help those studing this book.

# How this repository works:
For each chapter, there are two parts (The Chapter Projects) and (The Practice Projects). In each chapter folder, you will find the two parts grouped in a neat way to make it easy for you to follow along.
